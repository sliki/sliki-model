temporary doc to capture some notions. 

documents should support markdown or html5

use template braces notation to embed messages or do other interesing things

e.g., {{ messageIds('xxx','yyy','zzz') }}

or maybe {{ messagesWhere({a='xxx',b='yyy'}) }}

etc.


Admin Service
=============

Create/manage org and/or user accounts, personas, groups


Auth Service
============

Authenticate user/persona (login) and manage session state


Message Service
===============

Post messages to queues

Persist messages

Route messages to listeners (persist in listener/context space)


Document Service
================

Create/manage documents

Map document ids (UUIDs) to REST spaces

  - the sliki (my) philosophy is that heirarchies are at least somewhat evil (frequently arbitrary,
    and often plain wrong except along the narrowest dimensions), so multiple paths to docs
    may exist as suits the needs of users.
    
  - a canonical form might be something like //{{publisher-domain}}/docs-by-unique-id/{{uuid}}
